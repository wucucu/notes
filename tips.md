Version â‰¥ 2.8.0, force to set username and password for a initial git repo
```
[user]
    useconfigonly = true
```
or
```sh
git config --global user.userconfigonly true
```

then in first commit it shows
```
fatal: user.useConfigOnly set but no name given
```

This is useful when you want to set up ssh for different accounts from a same remote service provider, like, bitbucket.org.

Notice, after setup, we need to change the server name in the config setting remote.origin.url, refer to the last part of the first anwser.
